    <h3>Method</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>STEP 1
            Put a large saucepan of water on to boil.</li>
        <li>STEP 2
            Finely chop the 100g pancetta, having first removed any rind. 
            Finely grate 50g pecorino cheese and 50g parmesan and mix them together.</li>
        <li>STEP 3
            Beat the 3 large eggs in a medium bowl and season with a little freshly grated black pepper. 
            Set everything aside.</li>
        <li>
            STEP 4
            Add 1 tsp salt to the boiling water, add 350g spaghetti 
            and when the water comes back to the boil, cook at a constant simmer, 
            covered, for 10 minutes or until al dente (just cooked).
        </li>
        <li>STEP 5
            While the spaghetti is cooking, fry the pancetta with the garlic. 
            Drop 50g unsalted butter into a large frying pan or wok and, 
            as soon as the butter has melted, tip in the pancetta and garlic.</li>
        <li>STEP 6
            Keep the heat under the pancetta on low. When the pasta is ready, l
            ift it from the water with a pasta fork or tongs and put it in the frying pan with the pancetta. 
            Don’t worry if a little water drops in the pan as well (you want this to happen) and don’t throw the pasta water away yet.</li>
        <li>STEP 7
            Mix most of the cheese in with the eggs, keeping a small handful back for sprinkling over later.
            Take the pan of spaghetti and pancetta off the heat. Now quickly pour in the eggs and cheese. Using the tongs or a long fork, 
            lift up the spaghetti so it mixes easily with the egg mixture, which thickens but doesn’t scramble, and everything is coated.
        </li>
        <li>STEP 8
            Add extra pasta cooking water to keep it saucy (several tablespoons should do it). 
            You don’t want it wet, just moist. Season with a little salt, if needed.</li>
        <li>STEP 9
            Serve
        </li>
    </ul>
